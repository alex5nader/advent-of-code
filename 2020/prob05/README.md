# Day 5 Thoughts

Finals kept me from doing this one when it was released, so I worked on it the next day.

The problem describes the input format in terms of binary search, so I implemented
my solution using that algorithm. I later found out that the input actually just
directly encodes the ID in binary with 0 and 1 swapped for F, B, R, and L, which I
thought was fairly well disguised.
