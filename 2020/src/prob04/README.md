# Day 4 Thoughts

Another "simulation" problem. Given a large list of inputs, count how many are valid.
Not too difficult, but working out a functional-style solution was interesting. The
original input format was somewhat strange, but it wasn't enough to resist a few
regex-replaces.

Surprisingly, I actually finished Part 2 slower than yesterday's part 2, but my rank
improved from ~2k to ~200! Rust's type system made programming the validation a bit
weird, but I guess most people also had trouble getting them set up as well.
