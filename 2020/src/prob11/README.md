# Day 11 Thoughts

Interesting cellular automata problem today. Unfortunately, I spent 15 minutes
debugging when the only problem was `-1..1` instead of `-1..=1`. Part 2 was very
easy to solve thanks to a clever closure and while let.

I also wrote a little util for 2d vectors, in case it comes up again.
